## Contributing

Contributions and suggestions are always welcome! Please make pull requests from your own fork to modify Awesome MacroPad.

Imposter syndrome disclaimer: I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

The contribution guidelines below outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

Thank you for contributing!

The workflow is similar to the one explained in detail here for CircuitPython: [Adafruit : Contribute to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github/overview).

### Contribution Workflow Overview

You can either add a thread to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/prcutler/awesome-macropad/discussions) or send a pull request to add your MacroPad creation to the awesome-list.

If you would like to submit a pull request:

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/prcutler/awesome-MacroPad) on GitHub.
1. Clone the forked repo to your drive.
1. Add a remote using owner adafruit and the original URL.
1. Fetch the remote.
1. Merge main.
1. Create a branch.
1. Make a change.
1. Commit and push to your repo.
1. Create a pull request on the official repo.
1. Once accepted, repeat by merging from the official repo to your fork's master, and re-branch.

It's easier than it looks!  Have questions or need help?  You can [find me on the Adafruit Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5FBsBHU) as *Paul Cutler*.  You can also find me on Twitter as *@prcutler*  - feel free to ask me for help, I'm more than happy to help.
